                        <h3>A little About Us</h3>
                        <p>
                            Comic City is Lancaster’s favorite family comic book store! Our staff has a passion for the entire comic 
                            book industry that few can match, which is why we’ve dedicated ourselves and our store to bringing you the 
                            finest comic book experience in all of Central PA!
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Our grand opening fills a much-needed role as a hub for all the “nerdy types” that call Lancaster home. 
                            As our wonderfully weird and unique customer base grows, we moved into our first location—a spacious 
                            building, tripling our space and our ability to deliver geeky goodness!
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One of the great pleasures of working at Comic City is getting to know our customers, both the occasional 
                            and the faithful weekly shoppers. Lancaster is a wonderfully diverse, unique town—you never know who will 
                            walk through the door next! 
                        </p>
